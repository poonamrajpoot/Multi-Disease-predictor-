##Multi-Disease Predictor Web Application
This project is a Multi-Disease Predictor web app built using Streamlit. The app allows users to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on input medical data. The diseases covered include:

Heart Disease
Breast Cancer
Parkinson's Disease
Diabetes
The models used for prediction in this project include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Each model is trained with real-world medical datasets, providing reliable predictions for each disease.

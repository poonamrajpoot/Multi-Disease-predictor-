    The **Multi-Disease Predictor** is an advanced web application that leverages machine learning models to predict the likelihood of developing four critical health conditions: **heart disease**, **breast cancer**, **Parkinson’s disease**, and **diabetes**. 
    This application provides users with a simple and intuitive interface to input their health data, which is then analyzed by different machine learning algorithms to deliver an accurate health risk assessment.

    - **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression  
    - **Accuracy**: 85%  
    The heart disease predictor analyzes factors such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits. Logistic Regression, a binary classification algorithm, is used here to estimate heart disease risk.

    st.write("""
    - **Algorithm**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
    - **Accuracy**: 94%  
    This predictor evaluates data such as tumor size and other medical features. Using KNN, a simple and effective classification algorithm, the model predicts breast cancer risk with high accuracy.

    st.write("""
    - **Algorithm**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
    - **Accuracy**: 87%  
    SVM is used for this predictor, utilizing neurological data to classify the likelihood of Parkinson’s disease. The model helps in early detection of the disease, providing users the opportunity to seek medical attention early.

    - **Algorithm**: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  
    - **Accuracy**: 79%  
    The diabetes predictor assesses factors like glucose levels, BMI, and family history using an ANN model. While its accuracy is 79%, it provides a preliminary risk analysis to prompt users for further medical testing.

    st.write("""
    1. **Data Collection**: Datasets for each disease were sourced from medical repositories, including UCI and Kaggle. Features such as cholesterol levels, tumor characteristics, neurological data, and glucose levels were included.
    2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data was cleaned, normalized, and split into training and testing sets. For some datasets, feature scaling and data balancing (e.g., SMOTE for breast cancer) were applied.
    3. **Model Training**: Each machine learning model was trained on disease-specific datasets. The models include:
        - Logistic Regression (Heart Disease)
        - K-Nearest Neighbors (Breast Cancer)
        - Support Vector Machine (Parkinson’s Disease)
        - Artificial Neural Network (Diabetes)
    4. **Evaluation**: The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The accuracies achieved were 85% for heart disease, 94% for breast cancer, 87% for Parkinson’s, and 79% for diabetes.
    5. **Deployment**: The models were deployed using **Streamlit**, creating a user-friendly web interface for users to input their data and receive instant predictions.
